## Development

External code contributions are extremely helpful in the right circumstances. Here are the recommended steps.

1. Prior to contribution, please propose your idea in a [new issue thread](https://github.com/ropensci/targets-design/issues) so you and the maintainer can define the intent and scope of your work.
2. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
3. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to create a new branch, add commits, and open a pull request.
4. Discuss your code with the maintainer in the pull request thread.
5. If everything looks good, the maintainer will merge your code into the project.

Please also follow these additional guidelines.

* Respect the architecture and reasoning of the project.
* If possible, keep contributions small enough to easily review manually. It is okay to split up your work into multiple pull requests.
* Format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and check your formatting with the `lint_package()` function from the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package.
* Describe your contribution in the project's [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/NEWS.md) file. Be sure to mention relevent GitHub issue numbers and your GitHub name as done in existing news entries.
* If you feel contribution is substantial enough for official author or contributor status, please add yourself as an author in the  [`index.Rmd`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets-design/blob/main/index.Rmd) file and [`DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/ropensci/targets-design/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) file.
